## What happens when clicked

Pending individual analysis. An agent must read the recovered handler source and its relevant callees before it replaces this text.

## Handler evidence

- Source: [DecompiledSources/Tina16/resources/dfm/ui-evidence.json](../../../DecompiledSources/Tina16/resources/dfm/ui-evidence.json)
- Recovered role: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Current graph summary: Unresolved Delphi event handler TDebugUndo.sbUpdateClick, referenced by 1 UI event.
- Current graph behavior: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Current graph evidence: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Complexity: simple
- Distinct outgoing calls: Not present in the recovered resource.

## Direct calls

- No direct call edge is present in the recovered graph.

## Resource evidence

- Kind: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Modal result: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Checked state: Not present in the recovered resource.
- List items: Not present in the recovered resource.
- Image reference: Not present in the recovered resource.

## Nearby label candidates

Nearby labels are layout candidates only. They are not proof of behavior.

- Rank 1: lblListEmpty at distance 145.
- Rank 2: lblUndoIndex at distance 161.
- Rank 3: lblCount at distance 175.

## Analysis limits

- Do not infer behavior from the control class, caption, hint, glyph, or nearby label alone.
- Do not replace the pending status until the handler source and relevant call path provide enough evidence.
